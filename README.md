## What is this
My solutions for competitive programming contests (released after the contest ends of course)
## Why
I want to keep track of my progress and activity. It also gives me an easy way to look back on old solutions written in a way I can easily remember and understand. This also makes helping friends easier if I can refer them to my actual implementations, which I think are written in a bit more friendly way.
## Useful Stuff
I use setup.cpp as the base and usually work in files a.cpp, b.cpp, etc. I then use put.sh which is a short script I wrote. You call with:
```
# without file extension .cpp
./put.sh source_file problem_name
```
This lets me auto add then commit my source_file in the remote solutions/problem_name with a month-date time stamp to avoid naming conflict. Locally, I have no solutions folder and I'm able to work in a clean directory
